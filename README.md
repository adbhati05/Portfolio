Portfolio Website for Aditya Bhati

This website was developed using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. 

The packages I installed for this project were Vite, React, Tailwind, React-Router-Dom, Radix UI, Lucide-React, React-Icons, and EmailJS. 

It contains the following sections:
- Home (a short introduction).
- About Me (goes into more detail about me, includes paths to my resume and contact info).
- Skills (an interactive grid of elements containing the skills I've worked with).
- Projects (project cards containing info about projects I've worked on that contain links to their respective gihub repo URLs).
- Education (an outline of what university I attend, what major/GPA, and the courses I've taken that are relevant to my field.)
- Contact (contains paths to email me or visit my LinkedIn profile).

Future developments will consist of:
- Adding additional skills and projects as I work on more of them in the future. 
- A new section listing out any experiences I have research-wise or in the industry.
- A custom Error 404 - not found page styled to the theme of the site.
- An option for site users to type out their message in a form submission in case they want to contact me.
